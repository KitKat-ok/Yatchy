# In room temperature
Test time: 1d 9h 27m

Drift:
- watchy v2 with PCF8536 (which in my experience worked better than for other v2 users) - 19 seconds
- yatchy with 20 ppm quartz - 2 seconds

Conclusions:
- This watchy v2 would drift a full minute after around 3 days, which matches my experience and usage of it
- This yatchy would drift a full minute after around 31 days, which matches my calculations

# In normal, temperature changing usage
