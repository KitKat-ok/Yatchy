Test devices:
- watchy v2 with PCF8536 (which in my experience worked better than for other v2 users) 
- yatchy with 20 ppm quartz

## In room temperature
Test time: 1d 9h 27m

Drift:
- watchy v2 - 19 seconds
- yatchy - 2 seconds

Conclusions:
- This watchy v2 would drift a full minute after around 3 days, which matches my experience and usage of it
- This yatchy would drift a full minute after around 31 days, which matches my calculations

## In normal, temperature changing usage
So, outdoor, indoor like a lot, around 0Â°C

Test time: 20h 6m

Drift:
- watchy v2 - 11 seconds
- yatchy - 4 seconds

Conclusions:

Both drift more, as this test took less time. Yatchy drifts more than I thought but less than some thought and I feared. So yes, the drift will depend on your usage and the temperature outside. But it's still better than watchy.

## End conclusions & Future
It's a bit worse than I thought, but it's okay, but you should decide for your own. I will probably in the future use 5ppm quartz instead of 20ppm ones. The 5 ppm are harder to source, but are 4 times better than the 20ppm ones (Any 32khz quartz will fit, it just needs to be 12.5pF)
