# Ordering components
There is a spreadsheet for it: https://github.com/Szybet/Yatchy/blob/main/hardware/components-calc.ods

You need to adjust all values for yourself, after that it will give you a approximation of how much will it cost. Why it's not precise?
- Sometimes you need to order 1 component where the minimum is 5, so you order 5 (That's the case with pcb's)
- Sometimes it's advised to buy spare components if you screw something up (I Usually buy spares for all of them)
- Sometimes when ordering minimum + spares you hit the next price point, then it drops
- Sometimes, prices change
- Random taxes, discounts, shipping magic etc.
- Ordering things for more than 1 yatchy will make things cheaper, again, price tresholds, again, economy of scale (Small scale but scale). Also shipping will be splitteb between yatchies

So it's save to say it's precise up to +-15$, maybe even 20$

If you feel extra insecure and you don't trust me (You shouldn't) check the kicad files if the document misses a component

For me, the cost is arround 70-80$, without the labour and things like solder / flux
